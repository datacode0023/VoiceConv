a complete voice conversation system that runs in a web browser, supporting real-time, bidirectional audio.
The primary task is to architect a foundational AI pipeline from scratch. This involves managing low-latency audio streaming, orchestrating backend services, and implementing robust interruption logic.
You must build this system without relying on pre-built voice AI platforms. The evaluation will focus on your ability to engineer the core infrastructure and solve the fundamental challenges of real-time voice communication.Frontend : Audio Capture, Audio Transport, Audio Playback
Backend: WebSocket Gateway, Entire Pipeline
What Not To Use: Managed Voice AI Platforms like LiveKit (Voice), Pipecat,  Daily.co, Retell AI, VAPI, Omnidim etc.
Evaluation: Working system, your understanding, System Design, Latency Management.
